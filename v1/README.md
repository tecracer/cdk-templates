# cdk-templates

AWS CDK is th "Cloud Development Kit" which lets you programm CloudFormation Templates.

This is a collection of templates for the cdk

## Tooling

We use [tasks](https://taskfile.dev/#/) for scripting.

For switching profiles [awsume](https://github.com/trek10inc/awsume) is used.

### Deploy Templates

If you use `awsume`, then the env variable `AWSUME_PROFILE` is set. If you work with different accounts its better to call the cdk cli with profile parameter.

So with awsume:

`task deploy`

Or with cdk directly:

`cdk deploy`
